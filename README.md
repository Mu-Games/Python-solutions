# Python-solutions
The 22nd of October 2021, the first edition of the MU-games took place. Now it has been a few weeks since the third edition and the MU-games are a true phenomena. The MU-games are a mathematical programming event for all mathematics students at Utrecht University. The exercises are designed such that the students first have to think of a clever mathematical solution and then write a small program such that the computer will calculate the solution for you. The MU-games have been brought to life to show students that the mathematical knowledge acquired in their studies can be used to solve more concrete and programmable problems.

During the competition, students would write code in their own IDE and send their code to a server, which would test it by fetching some test cases and seeing if the program returns the right value.

## This Github project.
This Github project contains the solutions for all the Mu-Games projects discussed in the corresponding article. For every problem, we have given the solution in a pdf file, along with the corresponding Python solution in a .py file. To test the code given, we have included five testcases for every problem. One can also use these testcases to test your one solutions.
